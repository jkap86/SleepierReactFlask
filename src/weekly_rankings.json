His rushing upside is what has helped his floor and ceiling. Jones is third in rushing yards, second in rushing touchdowns, and fourth in red zone carries. He's been efficient but mundane as a passer. Jones is 21st in PFF passing grade and 32nd in aDOT, but he's first in adjusted completion rate and third in clean pocket completion rate. Jones can stack back-to-back QB1 outings this week against Seattle. The Seahawks are 11th in fantasy points per game allowed to quarterbacks. His short passing approach can serve him well if his playmakers can create after the catch. Seattle is ninth in passing touchdown rate and fourth in yards per attempt. The culprit is their inability to tackle. They are second in YAC and fourth in missed tackles. Jones is at the borderline of QB1/2.",

This is by far the highest slot rate he's seen during his time with Kliff Kingsbury. Hopkins responded with 3.55 yards per route run. We'll see how much slot time he gets this week with Rondale Moore likely to move back inside if Robbie Anderson is up to speed, but I have to tip my cap to Kingsbury for a moment. When on the outside Hopkins will matchup with Patrick Peterson (50% catch rate, 55.7 passer rating) and Cameron Dantzler (75% catch rate, 112.6 paser rating). Kingsbury would be wise to move Hopkins inside again some this week to take advantage of Chandon Sullivan (82.8% catch rate, 128.0 passer rating). Hopkins is a WR1.",

Kamara is eighth in opportunity share and ninth in weighted opportunities, but he's only 26th in red zone touches. The good news is that he's logged four red zone looks in two of his last three games, so that usage seems to be trending upward, as he has only two red zone touches in his other three games. The Raiders have been a tough team to run on, ranking top-ten in rushing yards per game, EPA per rush, and eighth in explosive run rate. They are seventh in adjusted line yards and tenth in open field yards allowed. If the Saints don't wait until the fourth quarter to get Kamara involved in the passing game, he should be able to do damage through the air. Kamara is third in target share (20.2%) and eighth in yards per route run. The Raiders are 23rd in DVOA against running backs, surrendering the third-most receptions per game, the fourth-most receiving yards per game, and the 11th-highest yards per reception.

Jackson has been the LCB predominantly, and Lockett will run about 46% of his routes against Jackson if they don't move him around more.

His snaps have hovered in the 60-62% range in three of his last four games. Fournette could be headed for a bounceback week against Baltimore, but there are concerns. The Ravens have allowed the 11th-fewest rushing yards, but they have also faced the sixth-fewest rushing attempts. Baltimore can be run on, as they have allowed the fifth-highest yards per carry. The Ravens are also 24th in adjusted line yards and second-level yards allowed. The biggest worry for Fournette is that his offensive line has been terrible, ranking 28th or lower in adjusted line yards, second-level yards, and open field yards. Another worrisome factor for Fournette is that he hasn't been particularly elusive. Among 58 running backs with 25 or more carries, he ranks 55th in yards after contact per attempt, 47th in breakaway run rate, and 48th in PFF's elusive rating. His heavy target share in the Bucs' offense could help save him, though, as Baltimore has given up the third-most receptions and receiving yards to running backs. Fournette remains an RB1.",

Since Week 4, Washington is 19th in pass defense DVOA, but they have held opponents to the fifth-fewest passing yards per game, 11th-lowest EPA per drop back, and 14th in explosive pass rate. Washington is also sixth in pressure rate. In the preseason (only 13 dropbacks), Ehlinger had a 149.3 passer rating with 13.2 yards per attempt and three passing touchdowns.

In Weeks 1, 5, and 6, when he has been healthy, he has a 74.8 PFF receiving grade and 2.92 yards per route run averaging 111 receiving yards per game. That would place Davis 28th in PFF receiving grade and second in yards per route run (minimum 15 targets) this season. Davis saw a 16.2% target share in those three weeks and 36% of the team's air yards. He'll run 90% of his routes against Alexander and Stokes. If Alexander follows Diggs, Davis will eat Stokes alive. Davis is a high-end WR2.",

The Steelers are one of the best defenses against the tight end position ranking third in DVOA with the fifth-lowest catch rate and seventh-fewest receiving yards per game allowed. There is an avenue for Goedert to finish with a good game here if he can utilize his supreme YAC skills. The Steelers are 14th in missed tackles and eighth in YAC, so if Goedert can break some tackles in the open field, he can get past this tough draw. Goedert is a solid TE1.",

Among 66 running backs with at least 20 carries, he ranks 60th in yards after contact per attempt, 25th in breakaway run rate, and 34th in PFF's elusive rating. He has remained a plus in the passing game, though, ranking 15th in yards per route run and 11th in PFF receiving grade (minimum ten targets), which will help him, especially this week. The Patriots are 26th in rushing yards per game, 28th in EPA per rush, and 25th in explosive run rate allowed. New England is also 30th in DVOA against running backs allowing the highest yards per reception.

While he's 11th in evaded tackles and 21st in juke rate, Harris is 44th in breakaway run rate and yards created per touch. He's only finished as an RB2 or better once over his last four games. Harris is a volume-based RB3 with RB2 upside if he scores a touchdown. Philadelphia can be run on, but it's fair to wonder if Harris can produce. The Eagles have permitted the eighth-highest yards per carry while sitting at 25th in EPA per rush and 23rd in explosive run rate.

No, I'm not a proponent of \"well, if we exclude all of the big plays then,\" but this game against Seattle looks like a massive outlier stacked against the rest of his 2022 resume. With all of that being said, Miami is a good matchup for Hockenson. The Dolphins are 23rd in DVOA against tight ends giving up the eighth-most receiving yards and highest catch rate, but they have also yielded the third-lowest yards per reception.

He's seventh in evaded tackles and eighth in juke rate but outside the top 50 backs in breakaway run rate. Another worrisome sign for Montgomery is that Herbert cut into his route rate.

He still leads the team in deep targets and now gets another secondary that is vulnerable against the deep ball (29th in DVOA against deep passing).

While Herbert might not take over this backfield with the dependable Montgomery around, he's still getting more run as of late. Herbert is one of the best rushers in the league. He's sixth in yards after contact per attempt, 20th in breakaway run rate, and 11th in PFF's elusive rating (minimum 15 carries). Herbert is also eighth in fantasy points per opportunity.

Hubbard was operating as the 1A in this committee. Even with the missed time in the game, he still led Foreman in rushing attempt percentage, target share, and route run rate. The above efficiency metrics are small samples, no doubt, but still, eye-opening for both of these backs. Hubbard finished the game with 11 touches for 73 total yards and a score as the RB21 for the week. Hubbard is an RB3 with upside in a plus matchup. The Falcons have the second-highest rush success rate allowed while also sitting at 29th and 22nd in adjusted line yards and second-level yards. They have given up the fifth-fewest rushing yards per game as they have faced the sixth-fewest rushing attempts per game. Teams have been happy to pass all game, but the Panthers look like they are deploying the Bears model. Run, Run, Run, and then maybe pass the ball. The Panthers' run blocking has been among the best in the league, ranking 11th in adjusted line yards and seventh in open field yards.",

Detroit is also 31st in DVOA against tight ends if we're viewing Gesicki from the traditional tight-end lens. They have allowed the seventh-highest catch rate and yards per reception.

He's averaged 16.5 touches and 67.9 total yards this season while relying on touchdowns (four total, eighth-most). He saved his day last week with two scores, but his role is slowly starting to dry up. Over the last three games, he has drawn only one target through the air, and finally, in Week 7, the route run rate flipped in Pollard's direction. Elliott is 50th in yards per touch, 43rd in juke rate, and 54th in yards created per touch. I would love to say the juicy matchup with the Bears' run defense vaults him into RB2 territory, but outside of his two luck-boxed touchdowns in Week 7, he face-planted against the Lions' hapless run defense with 3.8 yards per carry.",
